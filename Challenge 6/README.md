**Automated Benefits Realisation Reports**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: Benefits & Value Management

**Summary**

​Benefits and value management is becoming one of the key parts of project delivery. Being able to evidence the value brought by a project is vital for not only evidencing success but also winning work. However, structuring and presenting evidence of benefits is time consuming and difficult to design.​
​
We want teams to explore how we use benefits data to automatically create meaningful reports for both clients as well as upcoming contract bids.

**Pain Points​**

- I want to see clear evidence of benefits that have been or are going to be realised​
- I want reports that are easy to digest and provide clear evidence and insight into the value brought​
- I want to be able to quickly generate reports for all my benefits without significant time commitment​
- I want to be able to quickly identify what benefits are worth reporting on​
- I want to be able to generate benefits reports on the fly in order to demonstrate potential reporting value​
- I want to be able to use benefits management data from previous projects to define my strategy so that I can measure against the most appropriate benefits and ‘start with the end in mind’ 

**Personas​**

- As a benefits manager, I want to be able to quickly generate reports on my benefits, So that I can release my capacity and feel confident in my reporting quality​
​
- As a client, I want to be able to see clear evidence of benefits, So that I can feel confident in the benefits delivered for my project​
​
- As a bid reviewer, I want to be able to see past evidence of benefits realised for projects, So that I can make an informed decision about what contractor I select for my project​
​
As a senior leader, I want to be able to quickly review benefits being realised for a project, So that I can support teams in delivering the greatest value possible

**Context​**

Benefits and Value management is vital to ensure that projects not only evidence the value brought but also to direct resources to ensuring that the greatest value possible is achieved. In order to make this possible, benefits managers track every project benefit from inception to completion and beyond. Often, benefits are not realised for months or even years after a project and keeping track of emerging benefits after a project is delivered is a key part of a benefit managers role.  ​
​
In order to support benefit managers in evidencing the success of a benefit as well as assisting the with sharing progress information, we want teams to create a tool that generates automated benefits realisation reports.​
​
Teams will need to use existing benefits data to generate reports for use in both providing insight to clients as well as evidencing success for future bids. You will need to take into account the timeline of a benefit and advise the user on what level of progress a benefit is at and what level of certainty a report can be generated at.​
​
Teams should ensure accuracy of any reports generated as well as making them user friendly and easy to digest even for a layman.

**Dataset Description​**

For this challenge you will be provided with a benefits dataset. It will include information of benefits realisation as well as timeframes for realisation. There will also be information about how it is to be evidenced and the source of any evidence needed.

**Output​**

For this challenge teams will need to show a system of report generation and demonstrate it on the provided data. You should also consider what additional data should be collected to improve the quality of the reports and how best to incorporate realisation evidence.​
​
Teams should also consider including a method for analysing the current progress of a benefits and advising users on which benefits are ready for reporting and which are not.

**Benefits​**

The benefits of this challenge is released capacity and improved reporting. This could potentially improve how bids are won and how benefits are tracked and realised. By reviewing potential reports earlier and more easily benefit managers would also have the opportunity for earlier intervention in issues and intervention to ensure that reports are produced in the best way possible.​​​​​​​
