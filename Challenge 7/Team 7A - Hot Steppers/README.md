# Team 7A - Hot Steppers
**Solution**

Team Hot Steppers successfully created a prototype system for Gleeds' annual Global Challenge event. The challenge focused on well-being and the environment, and participants tracked their steps using a mobile app. Hot Steppers proposed creating their own application and data management tool for future challenges.

Their solution aimed to allow global employees to easily track steps, view live step counts, and compare results between teams and offices. The team emphasized accessibility, accuracy, and the ability to link physical activity to environmental impact. They explored options for seamless step tracking and considered manual contributions as well.

Hot Steppers implemented augmented reality (AR) to display step counts, providing an engaging and visual experience for participants. The AR feature was integrated into leaderboards, enhancing motivation and competition.
