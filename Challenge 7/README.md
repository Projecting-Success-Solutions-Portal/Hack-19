# Challenge #7

**Global Challenge Mission**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: People

**Summary**

Last year GLEEDS ran its “Global Challenge” for all their staff across the world. It is a yearly event that pits all teams and offices against each other to see who can be the biggest force for good. Over the years the Global Challenge has prioritised volunteering, schools outreach activities and fundraising. Last year, GLEEDS focused on well-being and the environment, which will be the core essence of the challenge moving forward. ​
​
In partnership with an app, in 2022, Gleeds challenged their staff to a 30 day steps challenge. The app connected with step counters on employee phones and  for every 5,000 steps an employee took in a day, they were able to plant a tree in Madagascar (planted by the third party, the Eden Reforestation projects). ​
​
Last year’s Global Challenge was very successful and saw engagement rates of 1700 employees participating (more than any previous year) and accessing the app with approximately 75,000 trees planted. Now, GLEEDS wants to see if they can do the same challenge every year (in October), but by creating their own application and data management tool to facilitate this.​
​
Teams will need to decide on the best way to track step counts across the world in a competitive manner with an environmental output. They will need to ensure that it is as easy as possible for teams to contribute and track their steps, it will also need to provide live league tables so that each team can see how they stack up against the other teams all over the world.​

**Pain Points​**

- I want to allow all employees across our global offices to track their steps​
- I want to see live updates of step count and how results compare between different teams/offices/countries​
- I want staff to be able to use any phone in any country to automatically track their steps​
- I want all staff to be able to see an environmental output linked to their physical activity (targets could be included in this) ​
- I want to feel confident that the data provided is accurate and up to date​
- I want to clearly understand where a staff member is situated, in what team and in what office​
- I want the options to allow other methods of fitness tracking i.e. swimming, cycling etc…​
- I want to be able to review the data with insightful visuals​
- I want to minimize the cost of running this event in order to maximize the contributions everyone can make towards the environment​
- Ensure that the app is accessible to all fitness levels and for employees with disabilities​

**Personas​**

- As a challenge participant, I want to be able to easily contribute my steps without technical issues, So that I am motivated to engage with the challenge​
​
- As an event co-ordinator, I want to be able to easily track the event progress and see the data live and be able to share results weekly with the global employees, So that I can ensure everything is running smoothly and I can use the data to help motivate all participants​
​
- As an environmental manager, I want to ensure that we are contributing as much as possible to environmental sustainability, So that staff member contributions can have the most impact​
​
-  As a team leader, I want the event to be accessible and easy to do to encourage more people to get involved and I want to see my teams data, So that I can motivate my team to do more steps and beat the other team leaders scores​

**Context​**

In order to deliver this challenge teams will need to think primarily about how they achieve seamlessly tracked step counts through all countries and devices. Due to various restrictions, some applications/tools cannot be accessed in certain countries. Additionally, maintaining an application that uses API access to fitness hardware across all possible devices may be an unacceptable upkeep cost when you take into account that this takes away from money going to a good cause.​
​
A possible solution to this is running the event through an existing application that has an API that can be accessed. Do not consider access costs as not allowed, just consider that the higher the cost to run this challenge the less money can be used for the cause. The challenge runs over 30 days and will need to run seamlessly for the whole event, keeping records consistently throughout.​
​
Another possible option is to allow teams to contribute step counts manually, perhaps using their own app and showing the counts to their manager. This may be easier but teams should consider how this might reduce engagement and reduce accuracy.​
​
Additionally, teams should prepare a system for storing and tracking the data on a global scale. How can we keep teams informed of how they compare to each other? How can we allow event co-ordinators to gain a deeper insight into how the event is going without risking GDPR issues? How can organisers run daily and weekly leagues and share the results with all participants?​
​
Lastly, teams could consider what the best way to achieve the greatest environmental change might be. For the previous challenge, GLEEDS paid the Eden project for 1 tree for every 5,000 steps. Should they use this same metric again or could there be a way for a bigger impact to be achieved while remaining engaging? How would your tool cope when the cause/charity changes?​

Dataset Description​

For this challenge you will need to use your own phones/fitness trackers to demonstrate the functionality of your solution. For analytics, you should generate your own data based on what your application collects. We recommend creating visualisations using around 2000 people.​

**Output​**

A successful result would be creating a prototype for a system that could allow teams all over the world to contribute their step counts. Accessibility is very important for this challenge and your solution should offer an equal and fair challenge to all.​

**Benefits​**

With the creation of a tool to run this event GLEEDS can greatly reduce the cost of running such an event and maximize their contribution to whatever cause they want to contribute to.
