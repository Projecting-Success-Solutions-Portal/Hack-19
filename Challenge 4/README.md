**Ricardian Construction Contracts**

2025 PDA Vision Theme: 
Contracts & Procurement

**Summary**

The legal landscape of construction is widely accepted to be highly complex and costly, even for seasoned legal professionals. The language of many contracts tends to be anachronistic. They use and refer to terms the average layperson doesn’t use in day-to-day business, some of which are still in Norman French. Because of this, most construction companies do not provide their operational staff with a copy of the Contract for the project they are delivering. Instead, it is often executed by the company executives and their lawyers and kept securely on the basis that it is only to be referred to,  but generally after, a dispute arises.

In short, the legalese of construction contracts is complicated for an average person to understand, creating uncertainty and unnecessary commercial friction for contractors and subcontractors simply trying to do their jobs.

Technology has evolved, and with increasingly sophisticated computers and algorithms, we can now bring the same efficiencies to construction that we have seen in banking, retail logistics, and, of course, Taxis. Ricardian contracts are not new, but their use has been restricted to and tested in less well-known areas such as DLTs, Central Bank Digital Currencies, and the swaps and derivatives market. They are compelling because they bring the best of Law and Technology together. Presented in clear terms for everyone to understand, the precise legal language and intent of a contract and the efficiency of smart contracts.

**Pain Points**

- I want to clearly understand the Contract I am working to without having to rely on expensive legal representation
- I want to maintain the intent and protection of proper legal documents
- I want my contract compliance to be machine registered and easy to prove
- I want shared control of contracts I agree to, cryptographically secured
- I want to understand easily what my responsibilities are in a contract and what any penalties are for failure to complete my responsibilities
- I want machine executable code to handle the evidence and replicate the payment terms for standard construction contracts so that I can get paid in good time

**Personas**

- As a small subcontractor, I want to easily understand a contract I agree to, So that I can deliver what is needed and understand my rights and obligations.

- As a small subcontractor, I want the payment terms of my Contract handled easily and automatically, So that I can complete my Contract promptly and efficiently without undue administration and stumbling across unexpected terms.

- As a main contractor, I want my legal documents to be automated and the terms clear, So that I can release capacity with my team, improve transparency with other entities,  automatically track progress and compliance, promptly pay my suppliers in accordance with our agreements and grow my business.

- As a main contractor, I want to ensure all legal practices are as straightforward as possible, So that legal resolutions are quick and transparent and my customers and suppliers are happy with my services.

- As a developer, I want to know that the Main contractor has the proper contracts in place and is paying its supply chain in accordance with our terms, So that my project can be delivered swiftly and with the least disruption or unforeseen disputes.

- As an investor, I want to know that the developer, the contractor and the supply chain have the appropriate terms to ensure they each have access to the funds I have deployed to deliver the asset I am investing in, So that payment is available and delivered quickly to ensure the most streamline project delivery.

**Context**

When you spend money at a vending machine, an automated taxi service or an APP, you enter into a contract and simultaneously deploy a set of smart contracts – the two are not the same. 

Smart Contracts are simple algorithms describing a business process in code so a machine can execute it – they are usually a series of IF/AND/OR statements. In the case of a vending machine, the algorithm sets the machine to work so it provides a product in return for the money paid. Common law establishes the obligation of the vending company to provide and the right of the customer to receive the product in return for the money. Similarly, when a customer procures a ride in an automated taxi service, a series of algorithms are put to work that directs a driver to the customer, who takes the ride and is driven to its destination, following which money is exchanged.

Another way to consider a Smart Contract is the automated performance of an already agreed contract.

In these cases, the Smart Contract and the law are different and separate – the former is purely code, with little to no legal recognition. In contrast, the law sits ubiquitously to one side of the Smart Contract and is rarely referred to because the business processes generally work sufficiently well to avoid disputes. 

Nevertheless, this approach is becoming increasingly commonplace because it represents a simple and effective way to exchange money for goods. One of the most successful companies to deploy this technique is Amazon – trillions of dollars change hands using automated processes and a vast array of Smart Contracts, which rarely, if ever, are disputed in a court of law.

On the other hand, Ricardian contracts present a different but equally efficient solution to the exchange of Value in more complex arrangements, such as construction – where disputes are quite common. Like the examples above, the business processes of construction are separate from the law of construction. However, construction business processes are far more complex than vending machines or retail transactions, and because of this, the separation of business processes from law leads to complex disputes. 

Because a Ricardian contract is based on its natural language equivalent, it is legally binding and machine-executable. It can therefore be used to automatically respond to the ebb and flow of rights and obligations to trigger the auto execution of payments (as in the vending machine example) in accordance with, not separate from,  the statutory provisions of the Construction Act. 

Another way to consider a Ricardian Contract is to see it as a legally binding contract that represents operational business requirements, structured in sufficiently clear terms that it can be machine executable so that Value can be transacted efficiently.

Using a standard form construction contract, we want teams to create the system for a Ricardian contract. It will need to be able to step through the various steps of the payment application process as set out in the scheme for construction contracts. Teams should also consider how the execution of the Contract can be cryptographically signed using something like a blockchain-permissioned ledger.

Teams will not be expected to and cannot create a system to process payment within a Hackathon. Anything teams create will need to be a representation of what would happen. Consider the concept as a whole and how it would be best used and demonstrated.

**Dataset Description**

Teams will be provided with an example of a standard form construction contract. You will need to use this legal Contract as a basis for your code and consider what would be needed to ingest documents like this automatically. 

**Output**

A successful outcome would be a prototype for a simple but executable Ricardian construction contract that reflects the Scheme for Construction Contracts terms. Ideally, this would include cryptographic exchange, storage and tracking concepts on a blockchain. 

**Benefits**

By improving clarity around legal documents and creating an environment that lifts the veil from the legal aspects of construction, we allow all entities in a project to clearly understand their responsibilities and potentially significantly reduce the need for legal intervention.

We foster trust and potentially impact delivery and productivity by levelling the playing field between large and smaller organisations.
